      Number using O6 output only:             203
      Number using O5 output only:               2
      Number using O5 and O6:                  127

    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   1,440    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      6
      Number with same-slice register load:      1
      Number with same-slice carry load:         5
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   113 out of   1,430    7%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       256 out of   2,860    8%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          377
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           217 out of     377   57%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  39 out of     377   10%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         121 out of     377   32%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              51 out of  11,440    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
